# Bird That Flaps

First challenge of the [20 game challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).

Game #1-b

> Flappy bird was a mobile game from 2013. It was a sleeper hit, gaining sudden and massive popularity in 2014, likely due to attention from a popular YouTuber at that time. The game was removed from the App store after it’s sudden popularity due to negative media attention.
> 
> The game is extremely simple, and was designed to mimic the feeling of bouncing a ping pong ball on a paddle for as long as possible.
> Flappy Bird is a popular first game for new developers, and is featured in many “first game” tutorials.

**Note**: I'll be making my own assets using [Krita](https://krita.org/) for the graphics and [beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co) for the sounds / music.

# Done:

**Goals:**

- Create a game world with a floor.
- Add an object that represents the main character.
- Apply a constant force to the character so it falls to the floor.
- Add obstacles on the right of the game area. The obstacles should slide across the screen toward the left. The obstacles will appear in pairs, with a vertical gap between them.
- Accumulate one point for each obstacle that the player passes. Display the score.
- Detect when the character collides with the floor or obstacles

**Stretch Goals:**

- Add some sounds that will play each time the player gains a point, and when the player loses.

**Personal Goals:**

- Make a main menu
- Add a "day/night" cycle
- Make a BGM loop for the entirety of the game.

# TODO:

**Goals:**

- Reset the game when a collision occurs.

**Stretch Goals:**

- Add some background art! Try layering the background and scrolling at a different rate to the foreground obstacles. This is called Parallax scrolling.
- Add a basic game-over screen to display the player’s score.
- Track the high-score between play sessions and display the high score alongside the current score.

**Personal Goals:**

- All Done
